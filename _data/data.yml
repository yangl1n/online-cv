    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      During my college years, I worked as a student assistant in the IT
      department of my university. This role helped me learn a lot about
      various IT systems and how they function. I gained experience in 
      working with network formation and management, which gave me 
      valuable insights into the practical aspects of IT.
      In the summer after my second year, I completed an internship 
      in the ERP department of a manufacturing company. This gave 
      me the opportunity to understand the entire process of the 
      company's operations and how the information center of the 
      factory works. I was exposed to a variety of tasks, including 
      data analysis, system maintenance, and user support.
      Through my experiences in both the university IT department and 
      the manufacturing company, I have developed a strong passion for
      IT and its application in the real world. I am confident that 
      my knowledge and skills will enable me to contribute meaningfully
      to any organization that values technology and innovation.
